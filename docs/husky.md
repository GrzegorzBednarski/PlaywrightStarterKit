# Husky

‚Üê [Back to main documentation](../README.md)

Husky is used to manage Git hooks and automate tasks like linting and formatting before commits. It helps enforce code quality by running tools such as [lint-staged](./lintStaged.md) automatically.

## Setup

After cloning the repository and running `npm install` or `npm ci`, Husky will be set up automatically (thanks to the `prepare` script in `package.json`). No additional manual steps are required for contributors.

## Configuration

### Pre-commit hook for monorepo

The `.husky/pre-commit` script is prepared to support both single-repo and monorepo setups. To add more packages in a monorepo, simply update the `packages` array in `.husky/pre-commit`:

**Example configuration (`.husky/pre-commit`):**

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# === Husky pre-commit hook for lint-staged in (mono)repo ===
# This script runs lint-staged in each defined package directory.
# Add more package paths to the 'packages' array as needed.

# Get the root directory of the repository
ROOT_DIR=$(pwd)

# List of package directories to check (add more as needed)
# For single-repo, keep as ("./")
# For monorepo, e.g. ("packages/app1" "packages/app2")
packages=("./")

for package in "${packages[@]}"; do
  cd "$ROOT_DIR/$package" || exit 1
  echo "[husky][pre-commit] Running lint-staged in: $(pwd)"
  npx lint-staged
  # If lint-staged fails, exit with error to block the commit
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "[husky][pre-commit] lint-staged failed in $package. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
  fi
done
```

**Configuration for monorepo:**

```sh
packages=("./" "packages/app1" "packages/app2")
```

This will run [lint-staged](./lintStaged.md) in each specified package directory before every commit, ensuring code quality across all parts of the monorepo.

## Customization

You can add more hooks or customize existing ones by editing or adding scripts in the `.husky/` directory.

**Common hooks:**
- `pre-commit` - runs before commit (currently configured with lint-staged)
- `pre-push` - runs before push
- `commit-msg` - validates commit messages

## Integration with Lint-staged

Husky and [lint-staged](./lintStaged.md) work together to ensure code quality:

1. **Husky** manages the Git hooks and triggers actions at specific Git events
2. **Lint-staged** processes only the staged files with linters and formatters
3. Together they ensure that only properly formatted and linted code gets committed
