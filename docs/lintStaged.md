# Lint-staged

← [Back to main documentation](../README.md)

Lint-staged runs a set of predefined actions only on files that have been changed and staged in Git before a commit. This ensures that only the changes you're about to commit are checked and processed by the linters and formatters, helping to keep the codebase clean and consistent.

## Configuration

Lint-staged configuration is located in the `package.json` file under the `lint-staged` section.

**Example configuration (`package.json`):**

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "**/*.{js,ts}": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "prettier --write"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Configuration breakdown:**

- **`"**/*.{js,ts}"`**: Matches all JavaScript and TypeScript files in the project
- **`"eslint --fix"`**: Runs ESLint and automatically fixes fixable issues
- **`"prettier --write"`**: Formats code according to Prettier configuration

## How it works

1. **Git staging**: When you stage files with `git add`, lint-staged identifies which files are staged
2. **Pattern matching**: Only files matching the configured patterns (e.g., `**/*.{js,ts}`) are processed
3. **Sequential execution**: Commands run in order - first ESLint fixes issues, then Prettier formats
4. **Automatic re-staging**: After processing, modified files are automatically re-staged

## Integration with Husky

Lint-staged works seamlessly with [Husky's](./husky.md) pre-commit hooks. When you commit changes, Husky triggers lint-staged to process only the staged files, ensuring code quality without affecting the entire codebase.
